# Welcome!

This is a basic scaffolding of a full-stack app and would be a decent starting point for applications using a similar stack.

Note: I'm a huge advocate for testing, and this boilerplate purposefully leaves out testing frameworks, so the test stack can be decided separately.

## Backend:

- Docker
- Python
- Flask
- OpenApi

## Frontend:

- Next.js
- Typescript
- React
- Tailwind CSS

Feel free to use however with no credit needed (this is original code, but was mainly just executing a series of commands)

I provide no support, guarantee, etc, etc. ðŸ˜‚
